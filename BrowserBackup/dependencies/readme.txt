
*) you can download new versions of geckodriver for Firefox here:
https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases
Sometimes Mozilla can release new version of browser which is not already compatible with your current version of geckodriver.exe
So you have to update geckodriver.exe in such case. This was already the case at least once.
